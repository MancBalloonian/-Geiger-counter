## Future extensions:

1. Find a model describing the physics
2. Search for plausable explanations for the high magnitude peaks observed during the descent in the plot for CPM vs flight time
3. Account for systematic + statistical errors
4. Separate ascent, descent data as a function of altitude (refer paper for more info)


## Points to be confirmed/ verified:

1. Calibration of the Geiger counter
